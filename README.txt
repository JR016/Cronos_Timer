*********************************************************************************************************************************************


PD: IF YOU SEE A BUNCH OF "*" CHARACTERS THAT CONTAIN A BLOCK OF TEXT, IT MEANS THAT BLOCK OF TEXT IS VERY IMPORTANT (LIKE THIS ONE). 
SO, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ THROUGH THE WHOLE FILE (BECAUSE YOU HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO, "Mr OR Ms IMPORTANT I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.")
AT LEAST READ THE TEXT ENCAPSULATED BETWEEN THE "*" CHARACTERS.

YOU MUST AT LEAST READ THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS (THE REAL IMPORTANT ONES):

IMPORTANT FOR PROGRAMME FUNCTIONALITY
COPYRIGHT STUFF


IF YOU DON'T DO SO, THEN DO NOT EVEN THINK OF COMPLAINING BACK, TELLING ME THE PROGRAMME DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE 
YOU CHANGED THE LOCATION OF THE EXECUTABLE FILE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
THAT WILL BE ONTO YOU, BUDDY.

********************************************************************************************************************************************************

IMPORTANT FOR PROGRAMME FUNCTIONALITY: 


DO NOT ELIMINATE THE "images" FOLDER, OTHERWISE THE PROGRAMME WILL NOT RUN.

DO NOT MOVE THE "Cronos.exe" FILE TO ANOTHER FOLDER WITHOUT THE "images","fonts" AND "sound_effects" FOLDERS ALONG WITH IT, OTHERWISE THE PROGRAMME WILL NOT RUN.

DO NOT DELETE ANY OF THE IMAGE, FONT OR SOUND EFFECT FILES, OTHERWISE THE PROGRAMME WILL NOT RUN.

DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF ANY OF THE IMAGE, FONT OR SOUND EFFECT FILES, OTHERWISE THE PROGRAMME WILL NOT RUN.

IF YOU SWITCH THE NAME OF THE IMAGE, FONT OR SOUND EFFECT FILES, THE PROGRAMME WILL EITHER NOT RUN OR WILL DISPLAY IMAGES,FONTS OR SOUND FILES IN THE WRONG PLACE.


*********************************************************************************************************************************************************
*********************************************************************************************************************************************************

NOTE: 


PYTHON FILES WILL NOT RUN IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A PYTHON 3 INTERPRETER INSTALLED IN YOUR COMPUTER.
IF YOU OPEN THEM USING A TEXT EDITOR LIKE "Notepad" OR "TextEdit" THEY WILL SHOW YOU THE SOURCE CODE THAT I WROTE FOR THE "Cronos Timer App"

I CREATED THE PROGRAMME IN WINDOWS 10, SO I AM NOT SURE IF IT WORKS IN OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS, LET'S FIND OUT :)
PYGAME IS REQUIRED FOR THE PROGRAMME TO RUN (IF YOU ARE RUNNING THE PYTHON FILES)

YOU CAN DELETE THE PYTHON FILES IF YOU WANT TO, THEY WILL NOT AFFECT THE MAIN EXECUTABLE FILE.
I INCLUDED THEM SO YOU CAN REVIEW THEM AND ADD NEW FEATURES TO THE PROGRAMME IF YOU WANT TO.

********************************************************************************************************************************

PERSONAL NOTES ABOUT THE PROGRAMME:

THERE ARE THREE WAYS TO CLOSE THE PROGRAMME, BY PRESSING "Esc" AND THEN RELEASING IT, BY CLICKING THE "X" BUTTON AND
BY CLICKING THE BUTTON THAT SAYS "Exit".

THE COUNTDOWN PROGRAMME STILL RUNS WHEN MINIMIZED.

THE COUNTDOWN EXECUTION FREEZES IF YOU MOVE THE PROGRAMME'S WINDOW, IT CONTINUES WHEN YOU DON'T.

EACH PAIR OF TWO DIGITS REPRESENTS THE HOURS, MINUTES AND SECONDS IN THAT ORDER FROM LEFT TO RIGHT.

THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF HOURS IS 99, AND THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF MINUTES AND SECONDS IS 59,
THE MINUMIM NUMBER FOR ALL OF THEM IS 0, IT CANNOT BE NEGATIVE.
(IF YOU SEE THAT IN SOME POINT IT GOES NEGATIVE PLEASE LET ME KNOK)

YOU CANNOT MODIFY THE NUMBER OF HOURS, MINUTES AND SECONDS OF THE TIMER WHEN IT IS RUNNING, YOU HAVE TO FREEZE IT OR
RESET IT.

ONCE THE COUNTDOWN IS OVER THE PROGRAMME WILL PLAY A BEEP SOUND EFFECT WITH A "Time is up" ARTIFICIAL VOICE,
TO STOP IT JUST CLICK ANYWHERE ON THE SCREEN.

THE SOUND EFFECTS WILL ALSO PLAY IF YOU STARTED THE COUNTDOWN AND THEN YOU RESETED IT,
THIS IS A BUG THAT I COULD NOT FIX, JUST STOP IT BY CLICKING ANYWHERE ON THE SCREEN.

THE PROGRAMME LOOKS AWESOME, UNFORTUNALY IT HAS A VERY BIG FLAW. IT DELAYS.
SOMETIMES WHEN THE COUNTDOWN IS RUNNING, THE SECONDS DO NOT DECREASE WHEN THEY SHOULD (PER SECOND).

IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE PYTHON IS AN INTERPETED LANGUAGE SO ITS EXECUTION TIME QUITE SLOW AND IT IS NOT GOOD WHEN
DEALING WITH TIME SENSITIVE OPERATIONS, OR IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE I CHOOSE THE PYGAME FRAMEWORK THAT IS QUITE OUTDATED
TO DEVELOP APPS, OR IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE I AM NOT A VERY GOOD DEVELOPER AND SO I COULD NOT FIND THE BUG THAT IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS FLAW.

IT COULD BE ALL THE THREE TOGETHER, LET'S FIND OUT.

HOWEVER, IF YOU FIND A WAY IN WHICH THIS FLAW IS USEFUL FOR YOU, THEN U R MORE THAN WELCOME, MY BUDDY.

ENJOY IT :). 

PD: IF YOU REACHED THIS POINT OF THE FILE, U ROCK BUDDY, U R A LEGEND.
